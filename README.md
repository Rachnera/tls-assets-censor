How to use:
- Add `Asset Censor` script
- Create a `censored/` folder at the very root of your TLS folder
- Drop the censored versions of the assets to that folder, keeping their full path the same*

*For example, if you want to censor to `Graphics/Characters/$Aka_Nude.png`, the censored version should be found under `censored/Graphics/Characters/$Aka_Nude.png`

An example is given in the present project with Little Simon portrait (see demo).
